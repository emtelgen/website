                <p>
                    The project I worked with a team on while employed by Michigan State University St. Andrews. We were tasked to create a website that took data from temperature and humidity
                    sensors that were located across campus and exported that data through a website that we created.

                    <h2>Step One</h2>
                    <p>Using Bootstrap functionality, we created the front-end of the website for users. This included a navigation bar with login and user details as well as access to separate areas
                        of the university. One could click on individual rooms with buttons that were located on a map, which led to a new tab that displayed graphs for the data in that room.

                        constantly updated.

                    <h2>Step Three</h2>
                    <p>Creating a database using MySQL that served to store all the information for the users, rooms, and sensors. The user database distinguished admins from normal users, who had greater access to
                        the data in the website.

                Additional modifications that could be used to make this website better would include more additions to the HTML used to make the website more visually appealing. Other aspects that could be added would be increasing the functionality of the graphs with more user interaction.
