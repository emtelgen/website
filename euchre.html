                <h1>Game Creation Using Java</h1>
                <p>
                    Using Object Oriented Programming with Java code to create the card game Euchre. During this project I learned how to utilize enums within Java classes, the best data structures to use for the particular task,
                    and how to best separate what should be a class and what should be a created data structure.

                    <h2>Step One</h2>
                    <p>Creating the separate classes. In this program I had a Card class with enums of Color, Suit, and Rank. I had a Deck class to make the deck of cards. I also had a Player deck to keep track of separate player hands and scores.

                    <h2>Step Two</h2>
                    <p>Adding specific methods in each class. Some methods I needed to utilize included a method in the Card class that determined the highest value card in a list of cards, a method to rearrange a player's hand if they were to pick up the 
                        dealer's card, and a method to deal out a list of cards to each player.

                    <h2>Step Three</h2>
                    <p>Establishing the functionality of the Main class. This involved a while loop to keep the game going until a team reached the maximum score of 10, several for loops to iterate through the list of players as they made their turns, and 
                        putting all the class methods to use within the main file.

                    <h2>Step Four</h2>
                    <p>Checking the program for errors through tests. An error I found during testing was that the code was not accounting for the fact that a card played that does not match the first suit or trump suit was being counted as higher than other cards,
                        when in reality they should not be counted at all. Errors like these had to be fixed in order to achieve the working program.

            <p>
                Additional modifications to this program would be creating a playable game. I created the framework for the Euchre game however I did not make it so that bots could play, or that information could be hidden and only presented to certain players. In the future
                I would like to add a GUI to the game and present this information in a playable way.
