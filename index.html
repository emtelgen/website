                    <p>In 2021, I graduated H. H. Dow High School with a 4.41 GPA. Upon graduation, I received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where I studied Computer Science from 2021-2023 and ultimately decided not to affirm after my second year. I transferred to Michigan State University where I am currently finishing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. </p>

                    <p>I was a part of the Varsity Girls Tennis Team throughout all four years of high school. I was part of a team that held championships in Valleys and Regionals all four years, as well as placed in the top five of States yearly. At West Point I participated in intramural sports every semester including competitive fitness groups and an orienteering team that placed in the top of our regiment.</p>

                    <p>Participating in clubs in high school such as National Honor Society and Key Club gave me an introduction to leadership and the necessity of leadership traits to a successful institution. I was a Team Leader at West Point, directly responsible for the successes and failures of my Plebes (freshman cadets). I was their first line and mentor for a year.</p>
